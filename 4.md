# What is the right identity to use? Can I still use a Service Principal for my AKS cluster? What is the difference between a system assigned and a user assigned identity?
#Aditional Prompt

#Answer
A service principal is a type of identity that is used to authenticate and authorize access to Azure resources. When using a service principal with AKS, you can use it to authenticate and authorize access to the Kubernetes API server, as well as to other Azure resources that your AKS cluster may need to access.

You can still use a service principal with your AKS cluster, but Microsoft recommends using managed identities instead. Managed identities are a newer and more secure way to manage identities in Azure, and they provide a number of benefits over service principals, including automatic rotation of credentials and simplified management.

A system-assigned identity is an identity that is automatically created and managed by Azure. When you enable a system-assigned identity for your AKS cluster, Azure creates an identity for the cluster and assigns it to the nodes in the cluster. This identity can be used to authenticate and authorize access to Azure resources.

A user-assigned identity, on the other hand, is an identity that you create and manage yourself. When you create a user-assigned identity, you can assign it to your AKS cluster and use it to authenticate and authorize access to Azure resources.

The main difference between a system-assigned and a user-assigned identity is that a system-assigned identity is automatically created and managed by Azure, while a user-assigned identity is created and managed by you. In general, if you need to manage identities at scale or need to integrate with other Azure services, a user-assigned identity may be the best option. However, if you need a simple and easy-to-use identity solution, a system-assigned identity may be a better option.
